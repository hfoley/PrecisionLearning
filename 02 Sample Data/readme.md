# Precision Learning - 02 Sample Data

The files in this location are the gzipped json files mimicked from VitalSource system documentation.  The ADLS Gen 2 storage account ending in "lake" will contain a raw container.  You'll upload these files below that raw container.  These files were generated from the public documentation for VitalSource (https://developer.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015721128).  You can upload them from within Synapse Studio, Storage Explorer, or whatever method you prefer.  A sample image of the Synapse Studio method is below.
